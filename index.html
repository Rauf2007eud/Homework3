            It's hard to believe, but GTA 5 was released seven years ago. <br />
            Over the years, Rockstar Games has managed to please fans with an
            excellent western Red Dead Redemption 2, and has also <br />
            released many major updates for GTA Online. But fans are <br />
            waiting for the announcement of a completely different game.
